Sweater Speaker
====

An interactive program to help you choose sweaters.

Caveat
----
Sweater Speaker only works on OSX where the ``say`` command is available. I'd love to say I made it failback gracefully if not on OSX, but no, not yet.

Install
-----

Simple:

	$ clone https://github.com/wmodes/sweater-speaker.git
	$ cd sweater-speaker
	$ python say_sweaters.py
